‚ö†Ô∏è Requires External APIs/Data (Future Work)
Hadith Verification Feature - This is the most complex requirement:

Needs: Hadith database with Arabic text, chain of narration (isnad), reliability grading
API Options to Research:
Sunnah.com API (has Sahih Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawud, etc.)
IslamicFinder Hadith API
Hadith Answers database
Ahadith.co.uk collections
Schema Required:
hadiths table (arabic_text, english_translation, book, chapter, number)
narrators table (name, reliability_grade, biography)
chains table (hadith_id, narrator_id, position_in_chain)
hadith_gradings table (hadith_id, scholar, grade: sahih/hasan/daif/mawdu)
Timeline: 2-3 days for basic implementation after securing API access
üé® Design Enhancements to Consider
Animated Islamic Patterns: Can use CSS/SVG animations or Framer Motion
Scroll Animations: Use Intersection Observer API for fade-ins
Auto-switching Placeholder: JavaScript interval for Arabic/English toggle
Countdown Timer: Only if you have actual launch date
Live Waitlist Counter: Requires backend counter + email collection
üìä Data/Content Needs
Scholar profiles (photos, names, credentials, testimonials) - You'll need to secure permissions
Statistics ("4,832 users waiting", "70% of viral hadiths are fake") - Need sources or remove
Feature mockup screenshots - Can capture from current working app
Custom icons - Can use Lucide React icons styled to match Islamic aesthetic
üöÄ Recommended Approach
Phase 1 (Today): Build landing page structure with:

Hero with search (links to existing /word analysis)
Problem cards
Features showcase with tabs
Static scholar section with placeholder data
Footer
Decision: Keep as separate /landing route OR replace homepage
Phase 2 (Future): Add interactivity:

Hadith verification (after API research)
Email waitlist collection
Real scholar data
Advanced animations
Would you like me to:
A) Build the full Phase 1 landing page now (replace current homepage)
B) Add it as /landing route (keep current homepage)
C) Focus only on specific sections you prioritize
D) Research hadith APIs first before building
